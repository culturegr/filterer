This package provides an easy way to add **filtering**, **sorting** and **paging** functionality to Eloquent models.

## Installation

Via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

``` bash
$ composer require culturegr/filterer
```

## Usage

Assume the follwing database scheme:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/culturegr/image/upload/v1596795985/OS%20Packages/Filterer/example_schema_humahz.png)

The `Client` model that corresponds to the `clients` table is shown below:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Client extends Model
{
    protected $date = ['registered_at'];

    public function country()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Country::class);
    }

    public function orders()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Order::class);
    }

    public function favoriteProducts()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(FavoriteProduct::class);
    }

}
```

> **IMPORTANT** Filterer package strongly relies on Laravel conventions for naming the relationships between models. Therefore, in order for the package to work as expected, the defined **model relationships should be named according to these convantions** 

### Using the Trait

Filtering, sorting and paging functionality can be added to the `Client` model by using the `Filterable` trait provided by Filterer package:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use CultureGr\Filterer\Filterable;

class Client extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
    ...
}
```

### Defining filterable and sortable fields

Fields that can be filtered and/or sorted must be explicitly defined using, respectively, the `fiterable` and `sortable` properties on the model. Both filterable and sortable fields may exist on the model itself or on its first-level relationships:
 - Fields that exist on the model itself are defined using the name of the column, i.e `columnName`
 - Fields that exist on a related model are defined using the relationship name followed by a dot `.` and the name of the column on the related model, i.e `relationshipName.columnName`

For example, in order to be able to both filter and sort the `Client` model by age, country's name, orders' items and favorite products' price, the following filterable and sortable fields must be defined:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use CultureGr\Filterer\Filterable;

class Client extends Model
{
    use Filterable;

    protected $filterable = ['age', 'country.name', 'orders.items', 'favoriteProducts.price'];

    protected $sortable = ['age', 'country.name', 'orders.items', 'favoriteProducts.price'];
    ...
}
```

### Supported data types and operators for filtering

The supported data types and their corresponding operations that can be performed when filtering resources are listed in the following table: 

| Data types                                               | Operators                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Numeric (*such as int, tinyint, bigint, float, real etc.*) | equal_to, not_equal_to, less_than, greater_than, between, not_between |
| Date (*such as date, datetime*)                            | between_date                                                         |
| String (*such as varchar, text etc*)                       | equal, not_equal, contains                                            |


### Filtering models

Filtered results can be obtained using the `filter` method (provided by `Filterable` trait) and passing an array as an argument that has a `filters` property which contains a list of desired filters, as shown below:

```php
Client::filter([
    'filter' => [
        [
            'column' => <FILTERABLE>,
            'operator' => <OPERATOR>,
            'query_1' => <VALUE>,
            'query_2' => null|<VALUE> // query_2 is required only with **between**, **not_between** and **between_date** operators
        ],
        ...
    ]
])->get();
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Œ§he `filter` method returns an instance of `Eloquent\Builder`, with the exception of the case where a `limit` property is passed as an argument (see [Paging models](#paging-models)) 

For example, the following filters can be applied in order to filter the clients that
 - have age between 35 and 40 
 - are from Greece
 - had made orders between the 1st and the 31st of May 2020
 - have favorite products that cost less than 10 euros
 
```php
Client::filter([
    'filters' => [
        [
            'column' => 'age',
            'operator' => 'between',
            'query_1' => '35',
            'query_2' => '40'
        ],
        [
            'column' => 'country.name',
            'operator' => 'equal_to',
            'query_1' => 'Greece',
            'query_2' => null
        ],
        [
            'column' => 'orders.shipped_at',
            'operator' => 'between_date',
            'query_1' => '2020-05-1',
            'query_2' => '2020-05-31'
        ],
        [
            'column' => 'favoriteProducts.price',
            'operator' => 'less_than',
            'query_1' => '10',
            'query_2' => null
        ],
    ],
])->get();
```

### Sorting models

Sorted results can be obtained using the `filter` method and passing an array as an argument that has a `sorts` property which contains a list of desired sorts, as shown below:

```php
Client::filter([
    'sort' => [
        [
            'column' => <SORTABLE>,
            'direction' => <asc|desc>,
        ],
        ...
    ]
])->get();
```

For example, the following sorts can be applied in order to sort the clients by
 - age, ascending 
 - country name, descending
 - number of items in their orders, ascending 
 - the price of their favorite products, descending
 
```php
Client::filter([
    'sorts' => [
        [
            'column' => 'age',
            'direction' => 'asc',
        ],
        [
            'column' => 'country.name',
            'direction' => 'desc',
        ],
        [
            'column' => 'orders.items',
            'direction' => 'asc',
        ],
        [
            'column' => 'favoriteProducts.price',
            'direction' => 'desc',
        ],
    ]
])->get();
```

### Paging models

Paginated results can be obtained using the `filter` method and passing an array as an argument that has a `limit` property and a `page` property, as shown below:

```php
Client::filter([
    'limit' => <VALUE>,
    'page' => <VALUE>
]);
```
> **IMPORTANT:** When `limit` is specified, the `filter` method returns an instance of `LengthAwarePaginator`. For more information on how Laravel handles pagination see [here](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination)

### Combining filtering, sorting and paging

Filtering, sorting and paging functionality can be combined using the `filter` method provided by `Filterable` trait and passing as an argument an array that contains any three of the `filters`, `sorts` and `limit`/`page` properties:

```php
Client::filter([
    'filter' => [
        ...
    ],
    'sort' => [
        ...
    ],
    'limit' => '...',
    'page' => '...'
]);
```

### Query string format

The argument of the `filter` method can be easily obtained by parsing a query string with the following format:

```
GET http://example.com/clients
    ?filter[0][column]=<FILTERABLE>&filter[0][operator]=<OPERATOR>&filter[0][query_1]=<VALUE1>&filter[0][query_2]=<VALUE2>
    &filter[1][column]=...
    &sort[0][column]=<SORTABLE>&sort[0][direction]=<DIECTION>
    &sort[1][column]=...
    &limit=<LIMIT>
    &page=<PAGE>
```
